## 3. Architecture Overview
This is a typical Java Springboot application that follows MVC architecture, organizing responsibilities into several layers:

- Controller
- Service
- Repository

In addition to these layers, the application includes:
- Client Layer: Responsible for interacting with external APIs;
- Custom Exceptions: Handles specific error scenarios;
- Utils: Provides utilitarian methods that are used for validation, objects creation, etc.

## 4. Setup and Installation
You have two methods to run the application:

- If you have Java 17 installed, simply execute it.
- Alternatively, if you have Docker installed, you can build an image and run it smoothly:
  - Build the Docker image with **docker build -t weatherforecast-app .**
  - Run the application using Docker with **docker run -p 8080:8080 weatherforecast-app**

The application runs on port 8080. Access the database via http://localhost:8080/h2-console using the credentials specified in the application properties file.
